# Psychopy Paradigm for the MFT fMRI Replication

For more information on the paradigm read the [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIdleJGiyqtjdhKCvUnPwdE2GkKPIbJm3RiuHO7b8zw/edit). To try it out, you can either run the .py script in python or open the .psyexp script Psychopy. Be sure to also download the other files in the same folder and unzip the SMID images. 

Because the python file did not work on each computer, please download the .psyexp files. 700 vs. 1400 stands for the TR's we used to calculate the repetition times; EN, NL for the language and the suffix 'hjkl' stands for the computer friendly version, where each of these letters stand for a button in the fMRI button box.
