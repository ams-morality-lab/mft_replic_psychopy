# Psychopy Paradigm for the MFT fMRI Replication

For more information on the paradigm read the [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIdleJGiyqtjdhKCvUnPwdE2GkKPIbJm3RiuHO7b8zw/edit). To try it out, you can either run the .py script in python or open the .psyexp script Psychopy. Be sure to also download the other files in the same folder and unzip the SMID images.
